# Unified State Graph

The Unified State Graph fuses three data domains for intelligent decision-making:

1. **Infrastructure Context**: Terraform desired state
2. **Economic Context**: Unit costs, budgets, Spot availability
3. **Security Context**: Compliant configurations, identity, risk

This prevents decisions that optimize one dimension while violating another.
